MUNDER DIFFLIN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM DESIGN NOTES
================================================

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------
This multi-agent system automates the core business operations of Munder Difflin Paper Company,
including inventory management, quote generation, and order fulfillment. The system uses 4 agents
working together to process customer requests efficiently and accurately.

AGENT ARCHITECTURE
------------------
1. BUSINESS ORCHESTRATOR (Main Agent)
   - Coordinates all other agents
   - Parses customer requests using regex patterns
   - Manages the workflow sequence
   - Compiles final responses

2. INVENTORY MANAGER
   - Monitors stock levels and cash balance
   - Provides real-time availability information
   - Alerts on low stock situations

3. QUOTE SPECIALIST
   - Calculates pricing with bulk discounts
   - Searches historical quote data
   - Applies tiered discount structure (5%, 10%, 15%)

4. ORDER PROCESSOR
   - Handles order fulfillment
   - Updates inventory levels
   - Manages supplier restocking alerts

WORKFLOW PROCESS
----------------
1. REQUEST RECEPTION
   - Customer request comes in with items and quantities
   - System extracts items using regex: (\d+)\s+(?:sheets?|reams?|rolls?|packs?|units?)\s+of\s+([^,\n]+)
   - Maps common item names to exact inventory names

2. INVENTORY VERIFICATION
   - Checks current stock for each requested item
   - Verifies sufficient cash balance
   - Identifies any unavailable items

3. QUOTE GENERATION
   - Calculates base cost for each item
   - Applies appropriate bulk discount tier
   - Searches historical data for similar requests

4. ORDER PROCESSING
   - Validates stock availability
   - Creates sales transactions
   - Updates inventory levels
   - Plans restocking if needed

5. RESPONSE COMPILATION
   - Combines all agent outputs
   - Provides comprehensive customer response
   - Includes inventory status, pricing, and next steps

KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES
----------------------
1. SMART ITEM MAPPING
   - Handles 50+ common item name variations
   - Maps to exact inventory names for accuracy
   - Supports paper types, products, and specialty items

2. BULK DISCOUNT SYSTEM
   - 5% discount for orders over $0
   - 10% discount for orders over $100
   - 15% discount for orders over $500

3. REAL-TIME INVENTORY TRACKING
   - SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Transaction-based stock level calculation
   - Date-aware inventory snapshots

4. ERROR HANDLING
   - Graceful handling of missing items
   - Insufficient stock alerts
   - Cash balance validation

5. HISTORICAL LEARNING
   - Searches past quotes for pricing guidance
   - Uses metadata for job type and event context
   - Improves quote accuracy over time

DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE

   - Inventory and quote history tables
   - Real-time data updates

4. OUTPUT LAYER
   - Formatted customer responses
   - CSV export of test results
   - Financial reporting

INTEGRATION POINTS
------------------
1. DATABASE INTEGRATION
   - Uses existing database functions
   - Maintains transaction integrity
   - Supports concurrent operations

2. EXTERNAL API
   - OpenAI-compatible endpoint
   - Custom base URL for Udacity platform
   - Environment variable configuration

3. FILE SYSTEM
   - CSV data import/export
   - Test result logging
   - Configuration management
