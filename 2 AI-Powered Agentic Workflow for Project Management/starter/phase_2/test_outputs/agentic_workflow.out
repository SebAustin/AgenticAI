 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
2) Generate product features by grouping related stories.
Worker Agent Response:
To generate product features by grouping related stories, you would first need to review all the user stories gathered for the product. Next, you would identify user stories that are similar or related in terms of functionality or purpose. Once you have identified these similar user stories, you can organize them into cohesive groups based on their commonalities. These cohesive groups of user stories then form the basis for defining the product features. By grouping related stories together, you can ensure that the product features are well-defined and address the various needs and requirements of the users.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not meet the criteria as it does not present product features following the specified structure of Feature Name, Description, Key Functionality, and User Benefit. The answer focuses on the process of generating product features by grouping related stories rather than presenting actual product features in the required format.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, ensure that the response follows the specified structure of Feature Name, Description, Key Functionality, and User Benefit. Focus on presenting actual product features in the required format rather than discussing the process of generating features.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement
